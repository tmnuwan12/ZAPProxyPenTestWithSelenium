# Zap Proxy Penetration Test Using Selenium & ZapProxy API
Penetration testing web applications with Selenium, ChromeWebDriver & ZAP OWSAP Proxy

If you want to penetrate test a web application where there is a complex authentication mechanism such as
OAuth you can get away by using Selenium to emulate a user login and then navigate through pages of the web
site via Selenium. Once you setup the ZAP Proxy correctly when you navigate pages via Selenium ZAP Proxy will
actually monitor the page so that you can trigger attack on pages you scanned via Selenium. This is the idea
of the project here. You can use this code as a starting point to write a complete automated penetration testing
tool.

## Prerequisites ##

* Have [java] installed
* Have [maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed
* Have OWASP ZAP Proxy installed. Make sure ZAP-Proxy is installed in your machine.
* You can also run OWASP ZAP Proxy as a service in Windows.
